archaeology game:

3 tracked variables by the player:
Time
Labor
Funding

Each pit has a few characteristics:
Difficulty
Size (chosen by player)
artifact/feature desnity

Each variable makes a pit take longer to excavate

Place random features like battleship
Scatter artifacts around them according to some model

Start with a fabricated alien culture, then can move on to real world cultures and models

Start with a set site with enough room to keep someone busdy "all summer"
Then move on to contract type projects and introduce variable digging speeds.
Speed a group up by, say, 200%, and they start missing artifacts (which of course also speed them up) but reward with more time & funding (phases 2 and 3) if a "site" is found.  May or may not be a site in each phase!

Breakdown:
Get something on the screen
Try config files from the beginning
Work on excavating an individual pit in the command line
THEN work on timing, and choosing places to dig on the site
And then random site generation.
